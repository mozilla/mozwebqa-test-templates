We love pull requests. Here's a quick guide:

1. Fork and clone the repo:

    git clone link_to_your_fork_from_github


2. Create a new branch for your test:

    git checkout -b name_of_the_new_branch


3. Make your changes to the code (e.g. add or fix a test).

4. Run the tests (using the instructions given in the README.md file of each project). We only merge pull requests if all tests are passing and there are no merge conflicts.

5. Push the changes you made to your fork and submit a pull request.

At this point you're waiting on us. We like to at least comment on your pull request and may suggest some changes, improvements or alternatives. In general two people will review your request and once it meets all the requirements it will get merged right in.

If you encounter any problems with any of the steps from above or just are in a conversational mood, you can find us on [IRC](irc://irc.mozilla.org/#mozwebqa) or via the [MozWebQA mailing list](mailto:mozwebqa@mozilla.org).

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

* Ensure that your code conforms to our [Style Guide](https://wiki.mozilla.org/QA/Execution/Web_Testing/Docs/Automation/StyleGuide). A very useful tool for checking your code is the [Python style guide checker](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pep8).
* Check the [Web QA team page](https://quality.mozilla.org/teams/web-qa/) for more info.

And in case we didn't emphasize it enough: we love contributions!
