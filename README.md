Mozilla WebQA Test Templates
============================

This repository holds a template of Mozilla's framework for creating WebDriver tests.

The framework has been developed by Mozilla and is used across many of our automated
testing projects. It is designed to provide clear page objects and readable tests.

The template doubles as a working, albeit very basic, test suite which can gives
you a working base to build on from the moment you checkout the template.
