##PROJECT_NAME
=====================
Thank you for checking out Mozilla's PROJECT_NAME test suite. Mozilla and the Web QA team are grateful for the help and hard work of many contributors like yourself.
The following contributors have contributed to PROJECT_NAME:

Getting involved as a contributor
------------------------------------------
We love working with contributors to fill out the Selenium test coverage for PROJECT_NAME, but it does require a few skills. You will need to know some Python, some Selenium and you will need some basic familiarity with Github.

If you know some Python, it's worth having a look at the Selenium framework to understand the basic concepts of browser based testing and especially page objects. Our suite uses [Selenium WebDriver][webdriver].

If you need to brush up on programming but are eager to start contributing immediately, please consider helping us find bugs in Mozilla [Firefox][firefox] or find bugs in the Mozilla web-sites tested by the [WebQA][webqa] team. To brush up on Python skills before engaging with us, [Dive Into Python][dive] is an excellent resource. MIT also has [lecture notes on Python][mit] available through their open courseware.The programming concepts you will need to know include functions, working with classes, and some object oriented programming basics.

Questions are always welcome
----------------------------
While we take pains to keep our documentation updated, the best source of information is those of us who work on the project.  Don't be afraid to join us in irc.mozilla.org #[mozwebqa] to ask questions about our Selenium tests.  Mozilla also hosts the #[mozillians] chat room to answer your general questions about contributing to Mozilla.

Getting setup
-------------
It's easy to get setup, just two pieces of software to install and in 5 command lines you'll be running the tests!

### Install Python
If you don't already have it installed, please install [Python 2.6]
[Python 2.6]: http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.6.6/

### Cloning the test repository with Git

After you have installed [Git] you will need to clone the project to your hard drive. From your workspace directory run this command which will copy (clone) the project to your hard drive

    git clone --recursive git://github.com/mozilla/PROJECT_NAME.git
[Git]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_%28software%29

### Installing Python packages
You will need to install Selenium, py.test, unittestzero and some other project specific packages. Fortunately `pip` makes it easy to install all of these in one step. Let's start by installing pip:

    sudo easy_install pip
    
Now using pip we'll install the packages we need (which are listed in requirements.txt)

    pip install -Ur requirements.txt --use-mirrors

__Optional/Intermediate level__

##### Virtual Environments
The step above installs the packages globally on your operating system. Using `virtualenv` you can sandbox Python packages into virtual environments for each Mozilla project you work on. Follow our [Virtual Env guide] to get a virtual environment up and running. We recommend this practice.
[Virtual Env guide]: https://wiki.mozilla.org/QA/Execution/Web_Testing/Automation/Virtual_Environments

Running Tests
-------------

### Selenium
Once the above prerequisites have been met, you can run the tests using the
following command:

    py.test --driver=firefox

This command will locate your firefox install, load it and run the tests against it.

For other possible options, type `py.test --help` or view the [readme].
[readme]: https://github.com/davehunt/pytest-mozwebqa/blob/master/README.md

__Optional/Intermediate level__

##### Credentials
Some projects require user (login) credentials to be given so the test can log in and log out.

1. Create a user account on the site/environment you are testing.

2. Copy the credentials.yaml into a different folder and replace the values inside with your user account.

3. Use the parameter `--credentials=/full/path/to/credentials.yaml` when running the tests

##### Destructive
By default only tests that do not write data to the website or database will be run.
To run tests that write data to the website you must declare `--destructive` at the command line.

##### Selenium Grid
If testing across networks, operating systems and multiple browsers is your deed then it's a Selenium Grid you need.
Follow our quick start guide to get [Selenium Grid] up and running.

Writing Tests
-------------
If you want to get involved and add more tests, then there's just a few things
we'd like to ask you to do:

1. Use the [template files][GitHub Templates] for all new tests and page objects
2. Follow our simple [style guide][Style Guide]
3. Fork this project with your own GitHub account
4. Make sure all tests are passing and submit a pull request with your changes

[Style Guide]: https://wiki.mozilla.org/QA/Execution/Web_Testing/Docs/Automation/StyleGuide
